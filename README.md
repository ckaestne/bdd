# Simple Java and Scala implementation of a BDD library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckaestne/bdd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckaestne/bdd)

Should allow for automatic garbage collection, since all caches use weak hashmaps. 
Quite a bit slower than JavaBDD or similar libraries though.

See branch `bounded` for an implementation that can be bound to an interaction degree.

See https://github.com/ckaestne/vbdd for a multi-terminal BDD version that is useful for variational execution.
